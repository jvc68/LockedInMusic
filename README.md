For keeping track of total progress and comparing how the individual pages look as to try and maintain a theme throughout them.

IMPORTANT
So github can be weird so to make it as easy as possible I think we should use https://download-directory.github.io/ to download individual folders that can then be opened inside of VS code, as I like to use seperate .css files to save room in the actual HTML file. To do this, navigate to the folder that you want and copy the url of the page you're on, paste this URL into https://download-directory.github.io/, and it will zip the whole thing and download it for you. Once you unzip it, simply go to the folder, FYP for example, and open it via VS code.
